<p><span lang="en-us">Hi,</span></p>

<p><span lang="en-us">With this program you'll be able to 
quickly run an entire website.<br>
This website pretty much looks like a FTP server, coz you have some links that 
all load a page where you can download<br>
files from a directory with a specific subject.</span></p>

<p><span lang="en-us">Ex.<br>
You can download music from the Audio folder.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">But you're also able to manage a forum, and even force 
users to register and login before they can use the site.<br>
Every time a user logs in there will be made a log save in the file: login.ini, 
located in your serverfolder.<br>
The file settings.ini contains all your settings and is always located in the 
same directory as the executable (so the executable doesn't have<br>
to be in the server folder)</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">You can set if you want the forum to be active, if you 
want users to login, which links must appear, what the serverfolder is and the 
url of your website<br>
(this will appear for example in the 404 Page not found error)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span lang="en-us">You can change what ever you want, but you MUST leave 
my name in the code.<br>
You cannot ask a fee for the program unless I give you written permission.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">And please vote!!!</span></p>
